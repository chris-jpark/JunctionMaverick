Finally, we connect the information with Power BI where managers can see employee workload and issues.

1. Run the Power App to fill out the questionnaire that collects information on your status: work completed yesterday, agenda for today, and any issues that block workflow. 

2. The data will be stored inside an MS Excel database, where you can check to see the DB being updated. 

3. Once the forms are completed among employees, we use Power Autommate to send the dashboard of user statuses and a BI of team insights to the group. 

4. Inside the Dashboard, a manager can schedule meetings with employees that seek help at a time where both members are available. 

5. In the Bi, ... add info.
